### Exploring sailplane performance with Python and glidepy

glidepy is a Python module that implements basic calculations based on the glider polar.

The minimal requirements are three points of the glider's polar together with the associated weight.

"Coding and Soaring" is a series of Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the use of glidepy and to analyze various 
aspects of sailplane performance.
