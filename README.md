### Exploring sailplane performance with Python and glidepy

[![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://beta.mybinder.org/v2/gh/quantizimo/test/master)


glidepy is a Python module that implements basic calculations based on the glider polar and as a basis for performing 
simulations.

The minimal requirements are three points of the glider's polar together with the associated weight.

"Coding and Soaring" is a series of Jupyter notebooks that demonstrate the use of glidepy and how to analyze various 
aspects of sailplane performance in a documented and reproducible fashion.

These are the notebooks currently available:
